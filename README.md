This is a comprehensive Python project, using a Django framework, which implements all aspects of ‘CRUD’ 
(i.e. Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities). This project was created as a demo for the students of
my class to help them better understand my approach to projects and how I go about working through them.

Time to complete: ~3 hours
